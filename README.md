# Namaste React ðŸŽŠ

# parcel

1. creates a dev-build
   2.local-server -it creates a local server for you,it host a server
   3.Parcel is refreshing page for you also it means it is doing something,it is doing
   HMR-Hot Moduke replacement
   How parcel is doing that
   4.Parel is using File Watching Algorithm-written in c++,iot keeps an eye on the files,parcel is keeping track of every say you are doing in your project\

# Parcel is reducing time whenever swe save because Parcel is using caching,cachings things for uh

5. Caching-Faster builds (giving u faster devlopment experience beacuse it is doing caching )

# When we install parcel when we build projects,parcel quickly sneaked into our project and it also took some space (.parcel-cache) so this parcel will have files,those are kind of binary files and this .parcel-cache basically cache all the things you do,it is supporting HMR,it is watching all those files so that next builds devlop fasteer

-- a cache= is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster;
6.Image optimization

# this is a dev build,if i do prod build it will mnification of our file also

7.Minification
8.Bundling
9.Compressssion (it willm remove all the white spaces)

# parcel is also not doing tjhings on its own like minification parcel willn be using soe of the libraries stored in .praecl-cache,like we have pm modi asume him as react and amit shah as parcel,amit shah along with modi they exist separately but they r needed together to build the government and their are small minsters -finance minister,health minister these are these packages in .parcel-cache

10.Consistent hashing  
11.Code splitting
12.Differential Bundling - supports older browser- so that your project can run on older browsers
13.Diagnostic -
14.Error hamndling
15.Https - parcel also gives u a way to host your app on https suppose i only want to test on ssh https
16.Tree shaking algo- suppose we hacve 100 f(n) in our code but using only 4-5 f(n ) ,parcel will tree shake your files,parcel will--remove unused codes for uh

# Setting up Testing in our app

-Install React Testing Library
\_install jest in our app
-imstall babel dependencies
-configure babel by copy/v (i think by clicking outside)
-go to parcel depend.
-create a .parcelrc file as root file by clicking outside and copy,paste codes
-Configure Parcel Config File to disable a deault Babel transpilation
-Jest Configuration
why jsdom(browser-like) we choose?-when u run testcases so there is no server running,there is no browser,thsees testc.will not run on br.not run on googlechrome,so they will need a environment to run,a runtime to run where these testing code will be executed.
It is not a browser but like a browser which will give u the feautures of browsers

-Jest-npx jest -init
-As we r using jest version above han 28 we have to install a library

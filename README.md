 # Namaste React ðŸŽŠ 
 # parcel
1. creates a dev-build 
2.local-server -it creates a local server for you,it host a server
3.Parcel is refreshing page for you also it means it is doing something,it is doing 
HMR-Hot Moduke replacement
How parcel is doing that
4.Parel is using File Watching Algorithm-written in c++,iot keeps an eye on the files,parcel is keeping track of every say you are doing in your project\
# Parcel is reducing time whenever swe save because Parcel is using caching,cachings things for uh
5. Caching-Faster builds (giving u faster devlopment experience beacuse it is doing caching )
# When we install parcel when we build projects,parcel quickly sneaked into our project and it also took some space (.parcel-cache) so this parcel will have files,those are kind of  binary files and this .parcel-cache basically cache all the things you do,it is supporting HMR,it is watching all those files so that next builds devlop fasteer 
 -- a cache= is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster;
  6.Image optimization
# this is a dev build,if i do prod build it will mnification of our file also 
7.Minification 
8.Bundling 
9.Compressssion (it willm remove all the white spaces)
# parcel is also not doing tjhings on its own like minification parcel willn be using soe of the libraries stored in .praecl-cache,like we have pm modi asume him as react and amit shah as parcel,amit shah along with modi they exist separately but they r needed together to build the government and their are small minsters -finance minister,health minister these are these packages in .parcel-cache
10.Consistent hashing  
11.Code splitting 
12.Differential Bundling - supports older browser- so that your project can run on older browsers 
13.Diagnostic -
14.Error hamndling 
15.Https - parcel also gives u a way to host your app   on https suppose i only want to test on  ssh https
16.Tree  shaking algo-  suppose we hacve 100 f(n) in our code but using only 4-5 f(n ) ,parcel will tree shake your files,parcel will--remove unused codes for uh
